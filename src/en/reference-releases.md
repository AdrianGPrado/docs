TODO: Test other distros with snap install


# Get the Latest Juju

Juju is available for Ubuntu (and Debian-based OSes), CentOS, Microsoft Windows
and Apple MacOS. 

There can be 3 concurrent releases representing the stability of Juju's feature
set: [stable](#stable), [proposed](#proposed) and [development](#development). 

Unless you are testing new features and fixes, choose the current stable
release to manage cloud deployments.


## Stable

The current stable version of Juju is 2.1.2.

Stable Juju is suitable for everyday production use.

On Ubuntu, the easiest way to install Juju is from a [*snap*][snappy]:

```bash
sudo snap install juju --classic
```

You can also install Juju using `apt` by adding the following PPA:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository --update ppa:juju/stable
sudo apt install juju
```

## Proposed

Current proposed version is 2.1.2, which is the same as stable (above).

Proposed releases may be promoted to stable releases after a period of
evaluation. They contain bug fixes and recently stabilised features. They
require evaluation from the community to verify no regressions are present. A
proposed version will not be promoted to stable if a regression is reported.

To install from Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository --update ppa:juju/proposed
sudo apt install juju
```
