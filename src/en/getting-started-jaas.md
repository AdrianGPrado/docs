Title: Getting started with Juju as a Service

# Getting started with Juju as a Service

Juju as a Service (JAAS) is the fastest and easiest way to model and deploy
your cloud-based applications. You can deploy Kubernetes to GCE in 10 minutes
and build a Hadoop with Spark solution in Azure, all from your web browser.

When you use JAAS, Canonical manages the Juju infrastructure. This frees you
to concentrate on your applications. With JAAS you can deploy, configure, and
operate your applications on the largest public clouds:
[Amazon Web Services][aws], [Google Compute Engine][gce], and [Microsoft Azure][azure].

All you will need is access to your public cloud credentials and an Ubuntu
Single Sign On (SSO) account.

## Log in to JAAS

Open the [JAAS login page][jaaslogin] to begin.

JAAS uses your [Ubuntu SSO][ubuntuSSO] account for authentication - if you
don't yet have an SSO account you can sign up for one here (it's easy and free).

## Create a Model

<style>
table th, table td {
    background: #f7f7f7;
    border: 0px solid;
    padding: 15px 10px;
}

table.logos {
    background: #f7f7f7;
    border: 0px solid;
    padding: 4px 4px;
}

table.logos th, table.logos td{
    align="center";
    valign="center";
    border: 8px;
    border-style: solid;
    border-color: #ffffff;
  }
</style>

<table width="500" border-width="0px" cellpadding="5">

<tr>

<td align="center" valign="center" border-width="0px" >
<img src="./media/jaas-login-1.png" alt="Login to JAAS" />
<br />
Press the green Start building button to get started...
</td>

<td align="center" valign="center" border-width="0px">
<img src="./media/jaas-login-2.png" alt="Login to JAAS" />
<br />
... and reveal your (currently empty) canvas.
</td>

</tr>

</table>


This empty canvas is where you construct your [model][models] by adding and
relating applications from the Charm Store. Press the green '+' symbol in the
middle of the canvas to start finding applications in the Charm Store.

You will see a list of available charms and bundles with a description of
each. Select a [charm][charms] or [bundle][bundles] to learn more about it.

When you have selected a charm or bundle (hint: to see how easy JAAS makes
complex deployments, try the Canonical Kubernetes bundle!) it can be added
to your model by pressing the 'Add to model' button...

<table width="500" border-width="0px" cellpadding="5">

<tr>

<td align="center" valign="center" border-width="0px" >
<img src="./media/jaas-kubernetes.png" alt="Canonical kubernetes bundle" />
<br />
Press the green Add to model button to add it to your model.
</td>

<td align="center" valign="center" border-width="0px">
<img src="./media/jaas-deploy-changes.png" alt="deploying changes in JAAS" />
<br />
Press the blue Deploy changes button to deploy the changes.
</td>

</tr>

</table>

After you press `Deploy changes` you can adjust your model name and choose a
cloud. When you select a cloud, you will be guided through
the process of entering credentials for it.

## Prepare your cloud credentials

We recommend that you use each public cloud's identity and access management
(IAM) tool to generate a new set of credentials exclusively for use with JAAS.

See [Cloud credentials][credentials] for more information, along with the
following links for your specific cloud.

[Amazon Web Services](./help-aws.html#credentials)

[Microsoft Azure](./help-azure.html#credentials)

[Google Compute Engine](./help-google.html#download-credentials)

## Deploy

Click on `Deploy` to build your model in the selected cloud.

Deploying takes a few minutes - in this period, instances are being
created in the cloud, software is being installed, applications are being
related to each other and configuration is being applied.

<table width="500" border-width="0px" cellpadding="5">

<tr>

<td align="center" valign="center" border-width="0px" >
<img src="./media/jaas-deploy-1.png" alt="description here" />
<br />
Deploying a bundle can take a few minutes...
</td>

<td align="center" valign="center" border-width="0px">
<img src="./media/jaas-deploy-2.png" alt="description here" />
<br />
When complete, the application icons will turn grey.
</td>

</tr>

</table>



As the applications become operational, the colours in the model view will
change to grey and the pending notices in the inspector on the left will
disappear, to show that everything is working as expected.

!!! Tip: You can check and manage existing models through the JAAS GUI by
clicking on your username

## Use the command line

JAAS can also be used from the command line. Models you've created in the GUI
are also able to be operated against via the CLI and vice versa. In order to
use the command line, you will first need to install the Juju client software
on your machine.

Juju is available for various types of Linux, macOS, and Windows.
Click on the sections below for the relevant instructions.

^# On an OS which supports snap packages

   For Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial) and other OSes which have snaps enabled
   ([see the snapcraft.io site][snapcraft]) you can install the latest
   stable release of Juju with the command:

         sudo snap install juju --classic

   You can check which version of Juju you have installed with

         sudo snap list juju

   And update it if necessary with:

         sudo snap refresh juju

   It is possible to install other versions, including beta releases of
   Juju via a snap package. See the [releases page][releases] for more information.


^# From the Ubuntu PPA

   A PPA resource is available containing the latest stable version of
   Juju. To install:

       sudo add-apt-repository ppa:juju/stable
       sudo apt update
       sudo apt install juju

^# For Windows

   A Windows installer is available for Juju.

   [juju-setup-2.1.2.exe](https://launchpad.net/juju/2.1/2.1.2/+download/juju-setup-2.1.2.exe)([md5](https://launchpad.net/juju/2.1/2.1.2/+download/juju-setup-2.1.2.exe/+md5))

   Please see the [releases page][releases] for other  
   versions.

^# For macOS

   The easiest way to install Juju on macOS is with the brew package
   manager. With brew installed, simply enter the following into a
   terminal:

       brew install juju

   If you previously installed Juju with brew, the package can be
   updated with the following:

       brew upgrade juju

   For alternative installation methods, see the [releases page][releases].

^# For CentOS

   A pre-compiled binary is available for CentOS.

   Please see the [releases page][releases] for a link to the latest
   version.


## Register or login to JAAS

To connect to JAAS from the command line, enter the following command:

```bash
juju register jimm.jujucharms.com
```

This command will open a new window in your default web browser and use
[Ubuntu SSO][ubuntusso] to authorise your account. If the browser doesn't open,
you can manually copy and paste the unique authorisation URL from the command
output.

After successful authentication, you will be asked to enter a descriptive name
for the JAAS controller. Now you can operate your models or applications in
JAAS from the command line.

## View your models

If you previously added one or more models using the web interface, you can
view them in the CLI with the following command:

```bash
juju models
```

If you have more than one model, you will need to switch focus to one of these
before you can perform any actions:

```bash
juju switch mymodel
```

## Remove models

The model you created earlier is running in your selected cloud. If you want
to permanently remove it, you can use the JAAS GUI, or run the command:

```bash
juju destroy-model mymodel
```

This process may take a few minutes to complete, as Juju releases
the running resources.

## Next steps

Congratulations! You have now deployed a complex workload in the cloud without
hours of looking up config options or wrestling with install scripts!
