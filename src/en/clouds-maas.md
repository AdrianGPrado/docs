Title: Using MAAS with Juju


# Using a MAAS cloud

Juju works closely with [MAAS][maas-site] to deliver the same experience
on bare metal that you would get by using any other cloud. Note that the 
Juju 2.x series is compatible with both the 1.x and 2.x series of MAAS.


## Registering a MAAS cloud with Juju

Using the Juju `add-cloud` command, it is easy to add your MAAS clouds to
Juju's list of known clouds. The command is interactive, and will ask for
a name and the endpoint to use. A sample session is shown below.

Running...

```bash
juju add-cloud
```
...will enter the interactive mode. Enter the desired values to continue.

```
Cloud Types
 maas
 manual
 openstack
 vsphere

Select cloud type: maas


Enter a name for your maas cloud: mainmaas

Enter the API endpoint url: http://maas.example.org:5240/MAAS

Cloud "mainmaas" successfully added
You may bootstrap with 'juju bootstrap mainmaas'
```

This will add both the 'mainmaas' cloud, which you can confirm
by running:

```bash
juju clouds
```

This will list the newly added clouds, preceded with the prefix 'local:' which
denotes that these are local clouds added by the user:

```no-highlight
Cloud        Regions  Default        Type        Description
aws               11  us-east-1      ec2         Amazon Web Services
...
mainmaas            0                 maas        Metal As A Service
```

Before you bootstrap this cloud, it is necessary to add the relevant
credentials, as explained below.

## Adding your MAAS credentials

```bash
juju add-credential mainmaas
```

When prompted for "maas-oauth", you should paste your MAAS API key. Your API
key can be found in the Account/User Preferences page in the MAAS web
interface, or by using the MAAS CLI:

```bash
sudo maas-region apikey --username=<user>
```

**Note:** Juju does not echo this key back to the screen.

Now you can create a Juju controller with the bootstrap command:

```bash
juju bootstrap mainmaas mainmaas-controller
```

Above, the Juju controller was called 'mainmaas-controller'.

## Manually defining MAAS clouds

If for any reason you would rather define all your MAAS clouds in a
single YAML configuration file, Juju can also import cloud definitions.
