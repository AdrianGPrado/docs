Title: Change an application's series (prior to 2.3)

#  Change an application's series (prior to 2.3)

## Overview

When deploying an application with Juju you can specify the series it
will use, or use the default series for the model. Prior to Juju 2.3,
any units which are subsequently added to the application always use
the series specified at deployment.

With version 2.3 or later it's possible let Juju know you'd like to add
units with a different series moving forward by running the command:
`juju update-series <application> <series>`

Here we'll cover the manual steps on how to do this with earlier versions
of the software.

## Prerequisites

  1. Check that the current charm revision in use for the application 
  supports the series you wish to use in the future.  This can be checked in
  the [Juju Charm Store][charm-store].

  1. Name of the application.

  1. Name of the model where the application lives.

  1. Admin privilages to the controller where the model lives.

## Update

Start by switching to the Juju controller where the changes will happen using
`juju switch`.

Next, the database on the controller will need to be modified.  You'll need to
know which model the application is deployed to, the application name and the
series you'd like to use moving forward.

An example script can be found [here][appendix].

```bash
mongo-update-app-series.sh -m default -a ghost -s xenial
```
...should update the application `ghost` on the model `default` to the xenial series.
You will see some output similar to the following:

```no-highlight
MongoDB shell version: 3.2.12
connecting to: 127.0.0.1:37017/juju
2017-08-23T16:17:57.249+0000 W NETWORK  [thread1] SSL peer certificate validation failed: unable to get local issuer certificate
2017-08-23T16:17:57.249+0000 W NETWORK  [thread1] The server certificate does not match the host name 127.0.0.1
Connection to 10.106.28.244 closed.
```

Verify the update by checking the status of the application, getting the output in
YAML format.  Output from: `juju status ghost --format yaml` will look similar to:

```yaml
...
applications:
  ghost:
    charm: cs:ghost-20
    series: xenial
    os: ubuntu
...
```
